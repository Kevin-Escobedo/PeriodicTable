# Periodic Table
The periodic table modeled as a SQLite database. This is intended as an exercise as I took a chemistry class and thought this might be fun to do.

This does require that sqlite3 be installed, which you can do with:

## Debian/Ubuntu:
`sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev`

## To-Do
- [X] Implement queries
- [ ] Add functions to abstract queries
- [ ] Optimize/Refactor
